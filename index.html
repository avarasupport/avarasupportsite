            <p class="eyebrow">About us</p>
            <h2>Our mission &amp; our manifesto</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">
              Avara exists to make high-quality mentoring accessible to people who have talent, ambition and potential – but haven’t always had the same chances.
            </p>
          </header>

          <h3>Our mission</h3>
          <p>
            Social mobility in the UK is still deeply unequal. Too many young people and adults are quietly taught to lower their sights – that certain universities,
            careers or opportunities “aren’t for people like them”. Avara was created to challenge that story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to connect people who have been underestimated with mentors who see their potential, help them grow their confidence and open up real,
            tangible pathways into education, work and independence.
          </p>
          <p>
            We work with schools, local authorities, charities and community organisations to build mentoring programmes that don’t just look good on paper,
            but actually change what feels possible for the people they support.
          </p>

          <h3>Our manifesto</h3>
          <p>
            Avara is built on a simple belief: talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not. We believe that where you were born, where you go to school or
            who you know should never define how far you can go.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our manifesto is a commitment to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stand alongside people who have been told “no” and help them find a “yes”.</li>
            <li>Partner with organisations who want to remove barriers, not reinforce them.</li>
            <li>Design mentoring that is grounded in lived experience, kindness and high expectations.</li>
            <li>Use data and insight to prove that change is happening – and push for more.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Every programme we build, every mentor we train and every match we support is another step towards a fairer landscape of opportunity.

        <!-- RIGHT: About Avara (organisation) -->
        <div>
          <h3>About Avara</h3>
          <p>
            Avara is an organisation that understands the pressures on both commissioning bodies and the people they support. We sit at the intersection of
            frontline practice, safeguarding, and technology – so you don’t have to choose between quality and efficiency.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>We understand commissioners and clients.</strong><br />
              We work closely with local authorities, schools, colleges and charities to align each programme with their outcomes, funding requirements and reporting needs,
              while always keeping the experience of the mentee at the centre.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We’re driven by outcomes, not activity.</strong><br />
              Our focus is on real change – in confidence, engagement, progression and independence. We support organisations to agree clear goals and then use Avara
              to track progress towards them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We deliver high-quality, cost-effective mentoring.</strong><br />
              Avara helps you make the most of every hour of mentoring time, reducing admin and duplication so more of your budget goes into direct support.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We invest in “best in class” training.</strong><br />
              Our training programme equips mentors with practical tools, reflective practice and safeguarding awareness so they can respond confidently to a wide range of needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We take recruitment and safeguarding seriously.</strong><br />
              We operate a thorough recruitment process and expect all staff and mentors to hold an enhanced DBS, alongside appropriate checks and references.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We match mentors to the right mentees.</strong><br />
              Avara’s matching tools make it easier to align mentors’ skills, experience and interests with each person’s goals and circumstances, so every programme
              feels purposeful and bespoke.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            No two clients are the same. Avara gives you a flexible framework to design mentoring that fits your context – while giving you the confidence that
            it meets consistently high standards.

            <summary>How is Avara different from a simple matching spreadsheet?</summary>
            <p>
              Avara automates sign-up, matching, communication prompts, and reporting – giving you real-time visibility into participation and sentiment. No more manual spreadsheets,
              follow-ups, or one-off surveys.

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can we run multiple mentoring programs at once?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. You can configure separate programs for different business units, locations, or mentoring goals while still reporting across them from a single dashboard.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do mentors and mentees need training?</summary>
            <p>
              Avara includes built-in guidance, templates, and nudges that help participants understand expectations, structure conversations, and set meaningful goals – no additional
              training budget required.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How long does implementation usually take?</summary>
            <p>
              Most customers launch their first Avara program within a few weeks. Our team supports you with configuration best practices, communication templates, and launch checklists.
